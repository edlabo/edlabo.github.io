I am a data specialist working in the natural and environmental sciences. I focus on data management and documentation to improve data discoverability and facilitate data sharing and publication. As part of data publication, I write human and machine-readable metadata records following discipline-specific or widely-recognized standards and co-author technical reports and papers accompanying scientific data. I curate, summarize, and QAQC scientific data from a variety of fields, including earth science/geology, geography, ecology, and wildlife biology. I also have experience with legacy data rescue to preserve institutional knowledge and transform scientific data from historical, paper, and/or analog formats into useable and accessible open non-proprietary digital data formats.
