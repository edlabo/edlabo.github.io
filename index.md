I am a data specialist working in the natural sciences. I focus on data management, documentation, and metadata creation to improve data discoverability and facilitate data sharing and publication, as well as editing and co-authoring technical reports and papers. I curate, summarize, and QAQC scientific data from a variety of fields, including geology, geography, ecology, and wildlife biology. I also have experience with legacy data rescue to preserve institutional knowledge and transform scientific data from historical or analog formats into useble and accessible digital data.
